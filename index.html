          <p><b>The Partners Affecting Learning (PAL) Video Workshop and Facilitation Tool</b> can help educational leaders unleash the often unrealized power of partnerships. You will learn how to form relationships based on common strategic visions of success. The information on basic partnership models will help you see that even your small scale strategic initiatives may form the basis of great “Project-based Partnerships,” that increase student success. The ideas on attracting potential partners, rather than asking for donations, are likely to be more in keeping with your highest level personal goals. Instead of being an additional task or burden, the Partners Affecting Learning (PAL) Evaluation Tool, can help you to facilitate Partnerships of Distinction that work for you and your partners. It may also qualify your partnerships for national recognition.</p>

         <p>The Partners Affecting Learning (PAL) Evaluation Tool, case study articles, and contact information for workshops at your location are all available through this special offer.</p>
